/**
 * Base service class.

 * This class represents the layer where application business logic should reside.
 * <br>
 * In larger applications, multiple services may be created to handle
 * different functional areas, following the principle of
 * <em>separation of concerns</em>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Example responsibilities for a service class include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Performing calculations</li>
 *   <li>Managing data transformations</li>
 *   <li>Coordinating between the UI and data layers</li>
 * </ul>
